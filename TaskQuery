OUTLINE: This task was completed using many tools only one of which was SQL. 
The tables that the queries in this file result are not always the final versions of the tables, and some of them provide inaccurate information. 
hey got eliminated or improved in the process of the data analysis.

Overall this file exists and published just to provide you with an idea of the funcitons and queries I am using to perform the analysis
